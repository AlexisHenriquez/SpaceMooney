LEARNING MATERIALS
------------------
Detailed learning material, which covers many of the features of the Fury Framework is
available online at: http://www.dreadware.com/fury/

UNITY INDIE USERS
-----------------
You should be able to play the existing tutorial without any modifications -- ie, it should
work "out of the box." However, when you want to modify the scene, you will have to implement
third-party AI and navigation. This is easier than it sounds! Follow the instructions 
in the following video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f42dDmU0_Hc

Fury uses an open-ended navigation system and you can implement ANY third-party pathfinding
and navigation componenets that you may own.

SOURCE CODE
-----------
Source code is not distributed with the package on the Asset Store. The reason for this is 
that source code is updated regularly and uploaded to a repository online. In order to access
the repository and download regular updates, please contact me directly.

CONTACT INFO & SUPPORT
----------------------
I will endeavor to provide thorough support to every customer, however, please realise that
this is a product designed for users with a basic grasp of programming. For obvious reasons, 
I cannot realistically teach you how to program C# and JS. 

For private questions, you can send a message to ali@dreadware.com. Please include "[FURY]"
in the subject line for quick responses. For general questions, please post on the following
